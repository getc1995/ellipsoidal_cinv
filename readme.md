# Ellipsoidal Control Invariant Set

This repo is an implementation of calculating control invariant set using ellipsoidal approximation.

Folder `altmany-export_fig` is forked from <https://github.com/altmany/export_fig> for saving nice figures.

To run the model predictive control optimizer for ellipsoidal constraints, you need to install `ecos-matlab` from https://github.com/embotech/ecos-matlab, which is an optimizer customized for SOCP programs.
